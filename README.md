# Virtual COM Port project on STM32F412 Discovery
This is a VCP project that peripherals of an STM32 microcontroller are controlled over USB. A user can read and change the logic state of any GPIO pin of the microcontroller, or communicate with a serial device connected to any UART interface of the microcontroller. For the project, I made a Python program with a graphical user interface which can connect to serial devices, send messages as text and hex with automatic calculated checksum value, and receive messages from serial devices.
